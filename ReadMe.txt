This program contains a simple example of reading and writing
text files in Java.
The WriteFile Class takes a path in its constructor
and allows the users to add strings to the file.
It is set to append to an existing file
The ReadFile class also takes a path in its constructor.
It reads the file, and loops through its contents
concatinating the lines into a string with line breaks
